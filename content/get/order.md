[d0x3d!] comes in two editions:

 - [ [d0x3d!] ](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/-d0x3d-): this edition includes everything you need to play [d0x3d!]: decks, tiles, pawns, chips and rules, packaged in a handsome black box.
 - [ [d0x3d!]: zero frills](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/-d0x3d-:-zero-frills-edition) includes everything above, in a standard box, without the organizational insert and without an instruction manual â€“ a slightly cheaper way to buy copies for group play.
