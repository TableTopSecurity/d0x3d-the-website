[d0x3d] is a game designed for informal computer security education, reflecting the following goals:

 - Engage new audiences, especially groups under-represented in computer science
 -  Be used both in and out of the classroom
 -  Be accessible to schools without technology funds or computer access
 -  Reinforce analyticsl-thinking and problem solving
 -  Improve security literacy, while increasing awareness of security careers and technology
 -  Inspire "adversarial thinking" and security role-playing
 -  Challenge assumptions that are barriers to CS, in particular: the field is not anti-social or isolating, there is no steep or disqualifying learning curve, there are no signnificant equipment costs.
