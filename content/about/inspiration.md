Our game has been inspired and indluences by many fun games, including Steve Jackson's [Hacker](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1250/hacker) and Matt Leacock's [Forbidden Island](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/65244/forbidden-island), published by [Gamewright](http://www.gamewright.com/). We believe the latter's expressly cooperative play is integral to our social and pedagogical goals.
